## Project Aims
The main goal of this project is to develop an advanced system for recognizing different physical activities. We plan to use machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to analyze data from sensors and show the results instantly through an Android app. This system combines various areas of technology, like working with sensor devices, analyzing data, developing mobile apps, and designing user-friendly interfaces. Our main focus is to bring innovation to how we recognize a wide range of human activities, from simple ones like walking and running to more specific actions such as detecting breathing problems while a person is still.

## Hardware Sensors
1. **Respeck Sensor**: Developed by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, this sensor is designed mainly for tracking breathing and other health-related measurements [6].
   
2. **Thingy (Nordic Thingy:52)**: A flexible sensor built with the nRF52832 Bluetooth 5 SoC. It’s versatile because it uses BLE and another technology called Near Field Communication (NFC) [9]. It’s great for gathering a wide range of movement data.
